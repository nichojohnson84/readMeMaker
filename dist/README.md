## Why did you build this?

- It's very easy for anyone to forget tasks they need to do.  Especially small ones that may seem like they aren't urgent until you realize you forgot to do them.

- I learned how to create and deploy an actual application!  I also learned about HTML and API Routes but I ended upnot going with the API Routes since all of the code was already in the server.js file but I saved them for future use.  We basically built our own server.

## Installation and testing

Once the repository has been cloned to your Git Hub Reposiory you simply save it to Heroku (you will need an account) and vist https://evening-journey-88259.herokuapp.com/.  I believe that if you log in to Heroku you can skip the installation and only see your own set of notes via the same link https://evening-journey-88259.herokuapp.com/.

## How do you use the program?

You have a Title and Text field and you simply type fill out the two fields.  BOTH fields must contain at least some text or it will not save.  Once you have completed your task or no longer need the note you can use the trash can to delete it.  While viewing a previously made note you can start a new note by either clicking the plus sign at the top right of the page or the top note that simply states Title.

### What language or programs did you use?

We used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NODE, EXPRESS and Git Hub for saving while we had Heroku for Deployment.

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I have actually commented out but saved two features of the app for API routing to make the code easier to maintain and cleaner.  This will also make it easier if I want to add any additional elements.

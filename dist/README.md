## Why did you build this?

- This is a great tool to have for any company that wants to keep track of employee's and who they work under and things like their job title and how much they make.

- I learned a lot of valuable information about using mysql and mysql2 to build out tables that you could use in a ton of scenarios where you are trying to keep track of a group and their different aspects.

## Installation and testing

From my repository you will go to companyTrackerHacker and use the code function to copy the repo.  Then just use git clone (paste copied repo) in your command line and push enter. You will also need to install a few programs by using the following commands. "npm i mysql2", "npm i inquirer", and "npm i console.table"  These programs will allow you to use the MySql program to view and edit your tables for your employee database.

## How do you use the program?

When you have loaded the programs you will open the regular git bash from the file companyTrackerHacker and then type "npm start".You will then just use the prompts to view, add, or delete employees, roles, or departments given a variety of options.

### What language or programs did you use?

mysql (mysql2), inquirer, node.js, jest for any testing, console.table package.  VS CODE and mysql workbench are also great additions to make it easier to view and alter.

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I think it would be great to add more to the tables to really be able to know everything you posssibly could about an employee just by looking at the table.  You could add working ours/days. Any special needs or conditions they may have or any other detail that would be valuable for your company files and directory.

### What did you learn while building this?

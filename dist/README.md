## Why did you build this?

- It is simple. Every project needs a good README. Even if you don't realize it or it feels like a waste of time, people who visit your site will view these documents. It is especially valuable for applying to new positions or simply to explain your program to a curious user.

- More than anything I learned how to use Node. I also think it is worth mentioning that when you have a great program like this you don't need to over think it. I also learned the importance of a strong yet simple README file for any project.

## Installation and testing

Use the link above to watch the video tutorial after you have visited my GitHub page where there is a link to clone (or copy) the repository. Once downloaded to the preferred location on your computer, load your code editor or GitBash (with node installed) and type "git clone (paste the copied repo) and push enter. This will download it to your computer. Then simply type "node index.js" and push enter to run the program.

## How do you use the program?

After downloading and installation you just run the program for any project and fill in the blanks and BAM! You have a professional README created that you can add to your project and be proud of.

### What language or programs did you use?

Node, Javascript, and JSON.

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I would like to add a place to include a screenshot and a spot to add your badge from the license provider.

### What did you learn while building this?

More than anything I learned how to use Node. I also think it is worth mentioning that when you have a great program like this you don't need to over think it. I also learned the importance of a strong yet simple README file for any project.

## Why did you build this?

- I built this project to save myself valuable time to work on the actual projects I have or just so I have more time to spend with friends and family.

- undefined

- More than anything I learned how to use Node.  I also think it is worth mentioning that when you have a great program like this you don't need to over think it.

## Installation and testing

Got to my repo page which there is a link to below and clone the repository.  Then find the correct file destination and type "git clone (paste the cpied repo) and push enter.  This will download it to your computer.  Then simply type "node index.js" and push enter.

## How does this program work?

Every project needs a good README. Even if you don't realize it, or it seems boring, people who visit your site will view these documents. It is especially valuable for applying for new positions.

### What language or programs did you use?



### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I would like to add a place to include a screenshot and a spot to add your badge from the license provider.

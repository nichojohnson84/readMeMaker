# oop-team-generator

This was a project designed to have us use Test Driven Development and Object Oriented Programing or TDD and OOP.  We had to try and use these methods to create a team generator for an office enviornment although it could be slightly altered to apply to a team of any kind.

## Why did you build this?

- To try and develop a better understanding of TDD.  It is a very complex process that sounds really simple.  Red, Green, Refract didn't seem to do it justice.

- I learned a lot.  I think you learn the most when you make mistakes over and over again.  Especially when you have almost no time to figure them out so you have to do your best with trial and error and online resources.  But I got much further than I imagined I ever would.

## Installation and testing

After cloning the program from my git hub profile you have to ensure that you have the correct module installed which are Inquirer and Jest (for testing) and then simply type in "node app.js" and it will ask you the questions and then fill out the cards for your team.

## How do you use the program?

I addidentally explained this already but one additional step I forgot is that once you have filled out the questionaire you will have a new index.html file in your output folder that has your team information on it.

### What language or programs did you use?

TDD, OOP, Javascript, Node, Jest, Inquirer, HTML, CSS

### Do you already have future plans for improvements?

I need to finish the project so that the page and cards have the correct styling.

### What did you learn while building this?

I learned a lot.  I think you learn the most when you make mistakes over and over again.  Especially when you have almost no time to figure them out so you have to do your best with trial and error and online resources.  But I got much further than I imagined I ever would.
